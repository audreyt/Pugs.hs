DrIFT-2.2.2:
  * redid build model, collect deriving rules automatically.


DrIFT-2.2.1:

 Mon Aug 14 19:22:26 PDT 2006  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>
  * update autotools to make autoreconf work
  * update README to reflect there no longer being a 'reconf' script
  * get rid of recursive make in docs/ subdirectory

Thu Jan 25 21:04:02 PST 2007  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>
  * add support for Data.Binary, move old Binary to BitsBinary


DrIFT-2.2.0:

Mon Apr 10 00:39:24 PDT 2006  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>
  * add note about reconf script
  * make the parser handle newtype deriving without bailing out
  * fix bug in Ord deriving rule

Wed Jan 18 03:59:21 PST 2006  David Roundy <droundy@darcs.net>
  * fix typo in src/Makefile.am

Sun Nov 27 02:59:14 PST 2005  Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk
  * Change rule for Haskell2XmlNew into XmlContent, add Parse rule.
  The Haskell2XmlNew class was a temporary staging post on the way to
  developing a new XmlContent class, available in HaXml-1.14 onwards.
  This patch updates the name, and the rule, to match the latest
  developments.  It also adds support for the textual (non-XML) Parse
  class, which is an experimental replacement for the Read class, using
  monadic parser combinators.  This is also currently defined in
  HaXml-1.14.
  * docs should refer to StandardRules.hs, not .lhs
  * fix docs for Hugs usage
  * keep docs of --list option up-to-date

Tue Nov 15 18:09:40 PST 2005  Einar Karttunen <ekarttun@cs.helsinki.fi>
  * Hook Arbitrary into DrIFT proper
  * Add UserRuleArbitrary

Thu Nov  3 02:52:38 PST 2005  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>
  * fix data derving for new versions of ghc

DrIFT-2.1.2:

  * fix rpm building, autoconf and some general make issues
  * fix warnings in generated binary instances
  * fix autoconf warnings

Mon Sep 12 08:11:10 PDT 2005  Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk
  * support for Haskell2XmlNew
  The HaXml library Haskell2Xml has been extended to make secondary parsing
  of the generic XML content tree into a typed value more robust.  An API
  change means that a new version of the class (unimaginatively called
  Haskell2XmlNew) exists, and this patch adds the ability to generate
  parsing code for the new class.
  * doc updates
  Fix some very out-of-date statements in the manual.

Tue May 31 16:17:12 PDT 2005  Samuel Bronson <naesten@gmail.com>
  * avoid problems with hmake by invoking ghc -M directly
  * Default to GHC to avoid NHC's tiny heap

DrIFT-2.1.1:

Tue Apr 19 21:09:13 PDT 2005  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>
  * Be sure to flush handles pointing to files before quitting
  * fix off-by-one line number error
  * Remove reference to genconf
  * Updated GenUtil.hs to fix nhc build


DrIFT-2.1.0:
 * added 'get' utility which creates foo_g for each label which returns its
   value in a failing monad rather than raising an error.
 * added 'from' utility which creates fromFoo for each constructors
 * no longer an error for DERIVEPATH to not be set
 * added -i to ignore directives in file. useful with -g and -r for testing
 * added 'Query' which creates from, get, has, and is functions, but in a
   class with an instance for the data type. useful for extensible data types
 * added deriving rule for 'Monoid'
 * added code subdirectory with support code

DrIFT-2.0.4:
 * added rule for GhcBinary
 * now allows record syntax with newtype

DrIFT-2.0.3:
 * 'update' functions now pass through values without the specified field
 * drift-ghc script added to be used with ghc by passing -pgmF drift-ghc -F
 * documentation updated.

DrIFT-2.0.2:
 * deriving 'update' works with newer versions of ghc
 * fixed bug in Show and Read instances

DrIFT-2.0.1:
 * fixed many warnings in generated code
 * support for strict fields in constructors
 * support for infix constructors

DrIFT-2.0rc4:
 * added help messages and categorization to rules
 * small isLiterate fix (TODO use nhcs deliterizer)
 * prints debug info in comment in chaseImports
 * code cleanups
 * integrated some changes from Strafunski 1.7
 * autoconf/automake improvements

DrIFT-2.0rc3:
 * fixed version strings in generated files
 * fix dependency generation
 * fixed example test cases

DrIFT-2.0rc2:
 * autoconf/automake added
 * texinfo is installed properly now
 * build system cleanups
 * works with both nhc and ghc again

DrIFT-2.0rc1:
 * new texinfo documentation, based on Noel's original manual.
 * new option '-r' to only emit results and not original source
 * new option '-g' to add new global rules to apply.
 * cleaned up old non haskell98-compliant hacks

jDrIFT-1:
 * proper GetOpt command line handling, allows you to specify an
   output file (-o) as well as list all possible derivations this
   version was compiled with (-l)
 * proper LINE pragmas in generated code
 * smarter error handling in some cases, parser smarter sometimes.
 * can deal with/ignore as appropriate some ghc extensions now
 * rules to derive Typeable used by the Dynamic library.
 * rules to derive Observable from the HOOD object debugger
 * rules to derive Term, a generic term representation for generic
   computation, can be used in a similar fashion to the Strafunski one,
   but has a number of advantages, fully lazy constant time implode/explode
   being the main one. (the external library is compatable with their work.)
